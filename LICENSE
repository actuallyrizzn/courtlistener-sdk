SUMMARY
===============================================================================

- CODE: AGPL-3.0 (copyleft, requires source code disclosure for derivative works)
- DOCUMENTATION: CC BY-SA 4.0 (permissive, allows commercial use with attribution)

This dual licensing approach allows for:
- Strong copyleft protection for the code (AGPL-3.0)
- Flexible use of documentation (CC BY-SA 4.0)
- Clear separation between code and documentation licensing terms
